          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            The Bible begins in Genesis. We meet God. We meet the first people
            that God made. We meet a man named Abraham and his family too.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Genesis gives us answers to some very important questions. Where do
            we come from? Why are we here? What is the problem with the world?
            How can the problem be solved? The rest of the Bible gives a more
            complete answer to these questions. But the answers begin in
            Genesis.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Genesis begins with the story of how God made the world.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            &apos;In the beginning, God created* the heavens and the
            earthâ€¦&apos; [1]
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Genesis explains that God created* the world. God made all things in
            the heavens and earth. He made the things that we can see and things
            we cannot see. Of all of the things that God made, on of his
            creation* was special. He made people. He made a man named Adam. He
            made a woman named Eve. He made a special garden where they could
            live. It was the perfect place for them. God wanted them to enjoy
            the world that he had made.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            God wants his people to know him, to worship* him, and to obey him.
            [2] But the first man and woman did not obey God. They chose to go a
            different way than God&apos;s way. They thought that their way was
            better. But the way they chose was not a good way. Because they did
            not obey God, God spoke a curse* upon them. He told them that their
            lives would be painful. He told them that they would die.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            God also showed grace* to Adam and Eve. God promised to rescue
            people from the bad way that they had chosen. He promised to send
            someone who would destroy the snake that had lied to them. [3] God
            gave them hope*.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Because the first man and woman did not obey God, God made them
            leave the garden. Their lives became difficult and sad. As
            Adam&apos;s family grew, so did the problems. Their first child
            killed his own brother. Soon, many people were doing evil* things
            that did not please God.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            So God chose to destroy the first people with a flood. [4] But he
            also chose to rescue one man and his family from this flood.
            Everyone but Noah and his family died. After that flood, Noah&apos;s
            family grew and grew. But even they did not follow God&apos;s way.
            They tried to build a city with a building so tall that it could
            reach God&apos;s home. But God judged them for this. He made it so
            that people could not understand each other. Soon, the people left
            the city and went about the entire world to find a home. [5]
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Many years later, God came to a man named Abraham. God made Abraham
            a promise. The promise God made to Abraham is one of the most
            important promises in the Bible.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            &apos;I will make you into a great nation and I will bless* you; I
            will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless*
            those who bless* you, and whoever curses you I will curse*; and all
            peoples on earth will be blessed* through you.&apos; [6]
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            The promise was to Abraham and his family line. Abraham had a son
            named Isaac. Isaac had a son named Jacob. Jacob had a son named
            Judah. Jacob made a promise to his son Judah before he died. [7].
            Jacob said that a strong king would come from the house of Judah.
            This king would be God&apos;s ruler. He would rule over the entire
            world.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Abraham&apos;s family did not always obey God. But God kept his
            promises to Abraham. God watched over them. God cared for them. And
            God kept them safe. God did not forget them. And he did not forget
            the promise he made.
          </p>
          <p class="b-section-2__text mb-sm">
            Abraham&apos;s family had to wait for God to keep his promise. But
            God would keep his word. The rest of the Old Testament* shows us
            how.
